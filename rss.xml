            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1> A friendly reminder to, “Talk Hard!”</h1><h2>"Do you ever get the feeling that everything in America is completely fucked up?"</h2><p>This question was posed by a t̶e̶e̶n̶ generation, who like most of my generation were filled with angst, dejected and rejected by the so-called establishment/society, when we began to realize that we were being used as capital then discarded as if we’re nothing. Sadly, we weren’t really listening, as it is just as relevant today, as it was 26 years ago, when the film “Pump Up The Volume” came out. (This is not to say this angst and rebellion is limited to my generation, but this was one of the first films (aside from Network (1976), that called on us to buck the establishment, and call them on their bullshit in no uncertain terms.)  When our moral and political compasses have become so screwed up, it’s hard to tell where to stand on most things. So it’s time we talked.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2d7080d-066d-45cf-8487-d0cdf5d0ece2.jpg"></article>]]></description>
